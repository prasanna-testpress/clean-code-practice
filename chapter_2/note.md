🧠 Chapter 2: “Meaningful Names” — Core Principles to Remember

Before the question, keep these in mind:

Principle	Description
Names should reveal intent	Anyone should understand what and why just from reading.
Avoid mental mapping	Never force readers to remember what r, x, or tmp means.
Make meaningful distinctions	Don’t name two things data and data1.
Use pronounceable names	address > addr; you’ll say it in meetings.
Use searchable names	Don’t use single letters — make it easy to find.
Avoid encodings	Don’t prefix with types or conventions (strName, m_, etc.).
