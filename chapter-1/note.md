🧠 Keep in Mind

Before you start, remember:

Clean code is simple and expressive.

It reads like prose.

It’s easy to change, test, and extend.

Names, functions, and structure communicate intent clearly.

Follow the Boy Scout Rule → leave code cleaner than you found it.

✍️ Uncle Bob says: “Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.”
